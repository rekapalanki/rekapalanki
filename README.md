- 👋 Hi, I’m @rekapalanki
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend dev with JavaScript and React.
- 🌱 I’m currently updating my Vanilla JavaScript knowledge with Wes Bos with rotating CSS turtles, hoisted regular functions, accept button intersection observer and other useful stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JavaScript and React projects.
